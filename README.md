turtle graphics class for Fabric.js

A first shot of a turtle graphics class for Fabric.js, this is not quite a class yet since it lacks real instanaces and it references a global canvas object, which has to be create with fabric.Canvas

This script is also visible at http://jsfiddle.net/alexlehm/cmM79/, the output of the examples is visible on my tumblr at http://tumblr.lehmann.cx/post/69023471380/turtle-graphics-in-fabric-js

This was mainly created as an entry to the challengepost competition of Fabric.js (since I was a fan of turtle graphics since the c64 days, it seems like a good idea).

The whole script could use a lot of improvement including comments and docs, the examples show the usual graphics.
